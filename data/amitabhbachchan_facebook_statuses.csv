जीवन खोजता आधार!

हाय, भीतर खोखला है,
बस मुलम्मे की कला है,
इसी कुंदन के ड़ले का नाम जग में प्यार!
जीवन खोजता आधार!

बूँद आँसू की गलाती,
आह छोटी-सी उड़ाती,
नींद-वंचित नेत्र को क्या स्वप्न का संसार!
जीवन खोजता आधार!

विश्व में वह एक ही है,
अन्य समता में नहीं हैं,
मूल्य से मिलता नहीं, वह मृत्यु का उपहार!
जीवन खोजता आधार!

QUESTIONS FROM GULF NEWS

1 The trailer reveal the deepest fears that every parent or a grandparent goes through: their loved one going missing. What were your thoughts when the film was narrated to you?

ANS//
Quite frankly when we hear a script we do not immediately try to internalize the gravity of the content. What one concentrates on is the creativity, the part to play and the makers who shall deliver and be in charge of the project. But yes, you do bring about a pertinent question – the worry and the anxiety that all parents go through when their loved ones are concerned .. its is indeed a fear that all of us go through ..

2. What made the trailer of T3N riveting was that the grandfather was struggling for closure after the tragedy to Angela. Do you think having closure makes grief about human loss more enduring? Or, is the lack of closure the worst way to live?

ANS//
There never can be closure on a tragedy that involves loved ones. It remains within us and persists in our thoughts regularly. That is a given. At times if there is some deformity, detail or factual circumstance that has eluded the unfortunate deed, then it becomes imperative for those that grieve, to make attempt till the very last call, in finding out the facts and the reveal. There are many real life unfortunate cases that we read about today where those affected still persist for facts and justice. The lack of closure is therefore a festering wound for those that live the tragedy each hour, and the desire and will to find out, is what keeps them active, not merely formally but informally too. This is exactly what John Biswas, the character I play in 'TE3N', is intent on achieving.

3 How vulnerable did you feel while playing this role? 

ANS//
……as vulnerable as the writing of the script, or the dialogues of the film. Personalizing the story or the character has many other connotations for an actor, and that then falls into another more detailed discussion.

4 You play a doting grandfather in real life. How much of your personal experience did you bring to this role?

ANS//
As I said earlier there are occasions when one delves into ones own circumstances and draws from it to represent on film. But then these are various methods actors use or perhaps use. Sometimes yes, these thoughts do invade the mind before a scene.

5 What was were the challenges associated with playing this role?

ANS//
To be as close to the character designed by the writer and the director.

6 How was it re-visiting Kolkota and what do you like about the city? Did you have to soak in the vibe and the atmosphere of the place? If  I were to visit Kolkota, where would I suggest I go or do?

ANS//
Kolkata was the first city of job. That is an important phase in one's life. So the city has a natural attraction because of this factor. Then having spent almost 8 years of your first independent life, has many memories and nostalgia linked to it. But most importantly it has been the people of Kolkata that have been its greatest attraction as far as I am concerned. They are the soul of the city and in many respects its passion and its culture. Being in their midst is just so enticing and invigorating. Where in Kolkata should you be and what you should be doing ..? Well, just land up there and go to any corner of the city and you shall have sufficient material to see and do  !!

7  Vidya Balan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are strong actors.What are your observations about them and what was your dynamic with them?

ANS//
Both Vidya and Nawaz are extremely talented artists and it has been a great learning for me to be in their company, to learn and observe from them.

8. If I were a fly in the wall on the sets of TE3N, what would I see on a regular filming day? Do you have any memorable anecdote to share?

ANS//
On a regular filming day you would have to be prepared to travel a lot. There was always great mobility at various locations for 'TE3N' in and around Kolkata.

9. In the age of oversharing everything on social media, how relevant are full-length feature films?

ANS//
Sharing on social media shall always be limited – at times to just 140 alphabets – but that does not take away the measure of the film when seen in totality on a large screen ..
Films shall always be relevant. That is a content that shall remain constant, irrespective of how it is delivered to the audience.

10. What according to you makes for a great murder mystery or a thriller? Which are your favourite ones and why?

ANS//
It is the suspense of how it all happened, that becomes the most exciting feature of any mystery thriller . 'TE3N' is no different form any other thriller. Some of Alfred Hitcock's films have been favorites .. 

11. A suspense thriller without a thrilling end is soul-destroying. Do you fear that the ending may not be satisfying?

ANS//
That shall be for the audience to decide. It would be silly of us to not make a product that is not soul stirring .. surely we not go out to deliberately make a wrong or bad film !

12. What would you tell all those parents, grand parents and family members who are struggling to cope with the loss of a loved one?

ANS//
My prayers and emotions with them. Sudden and tragic loss of a loved one is the most traumatic and one has to cope with it. But such is life .. you learn to live with it and its circumstances ..

13.  What are you deepest and darkest fears?

ANS//
The well being of loved ones ..

14. What did you learn personally from acting in Te3N?

ANS//
That it is most difficult to be simple in front of the camera ..

15. Is there a significance to the digit 3 in this one?

ANS//
Indeed yes .. and we shall all be anxious to know from you and the audience whether you are able to spot it or not .. That shall also form a part of the mystery ..

16. The fascination with serial killers is something that many TV shows and films tackle? Have you ever been fascinated by them such as Jack The Ripper, Boston Burglar etc?

ANS//
Yes I have .. 
And I think you have the name wrong .. its Boston Strangler, not Burgler .. !!

17. How has the year been for you?

ANS//
Another year ..

The people. They are passionate and warm and welcoming and filled with great emotion and  knowledge. Having spent almost 8 years working in Kolkata as an executive, it is a city that has remained close to me. On celluloid - well celluloid is over and extinct now, its all digital - Kolkata has some remarkable history and culture around and about it, most of it still unexploited and that makes the region rich for movie making.

ANS//
To remain as simple and unaffected as possible. And to keep away from too much Bengali because I had already done that in 'PIKU' .. recently released.

QUESTIONS FROM FILMFARE

1. Every performance of yours invites accolades. As an actor how much emphasis do you give to both appreciation and criticism?

ANS//
ANS//
Criticism is important and valuable. It shows you a mirror that you are unable to see. It teaches and I learn from it. Appreciation is humbling, but not something that one should get too overawed by I feel.

2. When was the last time you received criticism, which helped you as an artiste, as a performer?
ANS//
Each film teaches, and the critics bring out some aspect of the film or the performance which enhances your capacity to learn and understand. Sometimes it is difficult to mark a mistake yourself, until it is shown by another. That is something that should be valued. It happens in all the creative work that we do. And it is most essential.
3. Which was the last performance you watched (of another actor) that left you deeply impressed?
ANS//
Ranveer Singh in 'Bajirao Mastani' and Randeep Hooda in 'Sarabjit' …
4. What's the motivation that makes you look forward to going on the set?
ANS//
The continuity of another job ..
5. Would you agree that being happy at work is the best therapy after all?
ANS//
Oh yes .. those moments should be the happiest, else stop working ! When the camera rolls and the director shouts 'action', it is not a director, but a therapist healing your mind and body.
6. TE3N took you back to Kolkata. What made it memorable this time?
ANS//
Each visit to Kolkata is most memorable and enjoyable and nostalgic and filled with passion. The people and the city do this to you.
7. What was the challenge of playing a grandfather wanting to avenge the murder of his granddaughter?
ANS//
John Biswas, the character that I play is an Anglo-Bengali, is a lower middle class ordinary old man, weak physically and emotionally too. His effort is not to avenge so much, but to discover the truth and a confession of the episode and incident. Its one of the most difficult aspects of cinema to remain simple. Ribhu and Sujoy wanted that from me and I hope we have managed to achieve that.
8. Would you say playing older characters is far more liberating than playing a 'hero' was in the '70s – '90s, where one had to adhere to mass expectations? Are you enjoying this phase?
ANS//
Age does allow a greater variety yes .. and therefore is more challenging at times. But let us not overlook those early years as well. They were tough and difficult too. At this phase of my career one does get the benefit of a sublime liberation, of lesser responsibility for the box office return, not because the box office does not have meaning, but the return is not in the range of the bigger stars of the firmament. Our returns will not be in the massive range of the others, so we strive to achieve within our limited means …
9. TE3N has brought you again with Vidya Balan. What makes it special to face the camera with her?
ANS//
She is a celebrated and gifted artist and an exceptional co artist. It has been wonderful always to be in her company, both socially and professionally.
10. Nawazuddin Siddiqui – one of the finest talents we have… What was that special quality that you noticed about him as an artiste?
ANS//
The effortless ease of his demeanor in front of the camera. That to me as an artist is difficult to achieve, but Nawaz does it with such aplomb. Just watching him do that is a great learning.
11. Most of your younger co-actors tend to be your fans… Is it difficult breaking the ice with them?
ANS//

That is a misconception, for, I am their greatest fan. This generation has some of the most brilliant talents that I have ever seen. For me it is a fan moment to be in their midst. 
12. Aniruddha Roy's Pink is said to revolve around a father-daughter relationship? Its not quite clear. Can you please elaborate and explain the title?
ANS//
No it is not a Father-daughter relationship, but a relationship with 3 girls who could have been his daughter's age. It is a film on women empowerment and that is why it is called PINK..
13. A father-daughter relationship is said to be the tenderest bond. Do you agree?
ANS//
The tenderest and the most emotional .. 
14. There are a lot of special girls in your life… Shweta, Aishwarya, Aaradhya and Navya… what do daughters lend to a home?
ANS//
The aroma of ethics .. the hush of beauty .. and the smiles of their presence ..

15. 
16. Abhishek has often stated that he's your fan and your buddy apart from being your son. What makes him a special person?
ANS//
That he is my friend first and a son later ..

17. You've admirably adapted to every ear, with every director… Do you sometimes wish you could turn back the hands of time?
ANS//
Turn back the hands of time and do what ? The past is over, look upon it with nostalgia, its teaching, its pleasant memory and move on to the tomorrow, with expectation of betterment.
18. Fame, popularity, prosperity… are all offshoots of being in showbiz. But what is it that
19. 
20. 
21. 
 you as an actor really crave for?

ANS//
Another job ..

22. Audiences truly enjoyed your candid act with Jayaji in Ki & Ka. Did you enjoy it too while doing it? Do you agree that a woman invariably ends up sacrificing more in a marriage?
ANS//
Yes I enjoyed doing it and yes I do feel that the woman ends up sacrificing more. She suddenly realizes one fine day that she has to shift from the home she was born and brought up in, to another which shall now onwards be her new home. She undergoes a change in her surname, she now brings new life to the world and nurtures them, brings them up keeping all other chores aside, builds a home for them, much like her own parents did for her when she was born. All this needs respect and admiration.  
23. Jayaji and you have enjoyed a long innings together… What makes her a special friend, a special partner?
ANS//
She makes a home, that you long to come back to ..",Photos from Amitabh Bachchan's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/AmitabhBachchan/photos/a.452056338161494.108384.449082841792177/1292014044165715/?type=3,2016-06-20 23:56:24,40735,790,1681,40075,570,81,9,0,0

I'll say this in a story format...

----

A child is crying non-stop... The parents are unable to calm it down... 

They try everything they can... Feeding, singing, rocking it in their arms etc... The child doesn't stop screaming...

The grandfather, sleeping in the armchair, wakes up...

""Give that child to me..!"" he says...

The parents are uneasy... Grandpa is too weak to hold the child... But they have no choice...

They place the child gently in grandpa's lap...

Grandpa bends forward and starts crying louder than the child... Boo hoo hoo hoo...

The child stares at him for a moment...

And then starts laughing...

Both grandpa and child alternately scream and laugh for a while...

All is well...

Fact is:

All transactions are not rational... There are many which are indeterminate...

हमारा देश वो देश है जिसकी संस्कृति संसार की सबसे पुरानी संस्कृतियों में से एक है   !
दुनिया के अनेकानेक क्षेत्रों में जब मनुष्य असभ्य और जंगली था तब हमारे देश की संस्कृति पूरी तरह अपने भव्य रूप में थी   !

अल्लामा इक़बाल ने लिखा था :

""  युनानो मिस्र ओ रोमां , सब मिट गए जहाँ से 
लेकिन अभी है बाकी , नामो निशाँ हमारा ""
कुछ बात है की हस्ती मिटती नहीं हमारी 
सदियों रहा है दुश्मन दौरे जहाँ हमारा  ""

तो ये जो 'कुछ बात' है न, ये कुछ बात हमारी संस्कृति की पहचान है  !
इस पहचान के अनेक पहलू हैं , जिनमें से सबसे विशेष पहलू यह है, की हमारी संस्कृति में स्त्री को सबसे पूजनीय स्थान दिया गया है  !

"" यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यंते, रमन्ते तत्र देवता ""

अर्थात जहाँ नारी की पूजा की जाती है वहां देवताओं का वास होता है !
हमारी धार्मिक मान्यताओं में भी जहाँ कहीं भी सर्वश्रेष्ट की कल्पना की गई , वहां प्रतीक रूप में स्त्री स्वरुप की ही कल्पना की गयी -
ज्ञान की अधिष्ठात्री , या महादेवी - सरस्वती हैं -
धन की लष्मी -
अन्न की अन्नपूर्णा  -
यहाँ तक की, बल और ताक़त के प्रतीक रूप में भी, पुरुष नहीं, वरन ( बल्कि ) दुर्गा रूप की , काली रूप की, कल्पना की गई है  !

How Amitabh Bachchan tops the brand trust charts
Despite controversies and competition from a growing band of young celebrities, the superstar manages to retain the trust of consumers across age groups
Sandeep Goyal 

 
Amitabh Bachchan, Pranab Mukherjee, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore
President Pranab Mukherjee presents the best actor award to Amitabh Bachchan for 2015. Minister of State for I&B Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore looks on

 
Amitabh Bachchan has emerged as the most 'trustworthy' brand, winning across geographies, demographics and income classifications in a study on human brands conducted in end-2015 that covered about 2,500 respondents across five cities. No mean achievement for a septuagenarian who less than 20 years ago was almost consigned to the dung-heap as a spent-force.

'Trustworthy' in our research that mapped each celebrity over 64 parameters, is a combination of 'I-trust-him' and 'others-trust-him'. Plus it is an amalgam of 'trusted', 'honest', 'reliable' and 'dependable'. Bachchan scored high and his combined score leaves all the Khans, all cricketers and all Bollywood trailing.

What is the secret behind his lasting pull? I would put gravitas at No. 1. Interestingly, gravitas was one of the Roman virtues along with pietas, dignitas and virtuas - translated variously as spiritual, dignified and virtuous. Respondents, I was surprised, referred to an 'inner strength' that they felt Bachchan has, one that gives them comfort, confidence and trust. And here I thought that was the exclusive preserve of god-men and babas!

Bachchan's big advantage is that despite his age, he is current and contemporary. His movie roles are meaty and he is most times a central character. His contemporaries are either gone, or have meandered into full time politics. The only older Bollywood star in the active endorsement space is Hema Malini who has largely stuck to advertising for a water purifier brand.

How Amitabh Bachchan tops the brand trust charts Shah Rukh and Aamir are almost at the age at which Amitabh Bachchan started to anchor Kaun Banega Crorepati? But neither is transiting to mature (read older) roles. They are still struggling to look 10-15 years younger. In sports, the likes of Sunil Gavaskar, closer to the Bachchan age bracket are too narrowly focused on cricket, with an entire generation not having seen him play. So too for Kapil Dev. Sachin Tendulkar is too young at 40 to encroach into Bachchan's territory.

The study showed the overhang of KBC is Bachchan's most enduring brand asset. It changed 'the angry young man' of the 1970s-80s into a dignified, friendly and supportive older gentleman. Approachable, affable, in fact, adorable. The magic of the Big B was re-ignited.

The interesting feedback from the Human Brands study is that respondents believe he is trustworthy because so many brands trust him! I found that a bit difficult to swallow, but in our focused groups that followed the quantitative study, it was clear that consumers trust the Bachchan brand more as more brands use him. This is contra logic to the argument that it over exposes, in fact over milks, brand Bachchan.

Apart from his pole position on 'trustworthiness', Bachchan also comfortably makes the Top 10 on another very important attribute, 'fun'. He is equally at ease celebrating 'Pappu paas ho gaya' for Cadbury's Dairy Milk, to selling Gujarat as a tourism destination.

Two very interesting current questions need to be addressed however. First, is he an appropriate brand ambassador for Incredible India? Second, whether the Panama controversy has hurt Brand Bachchan. My view on Incredible India is that while Bachchan may be incredibly popular in India, and trusted, a potential tourist from NY or Tokyo may really not recognize or trust the Indian icon. On Panama though, I am abundantly clear that any controversy, true or false, does tarnish (or at least taint) the brand. If he is looking at a presidential role, he could do without the Panama hat. Still, Panama or Suez, they no longer make guys like him anymore. He is one of a kind.",Photos from Amitabh Bachchan's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/AmitabhBachchan/photos/a.452056338161494.108384.449082841792177/1268464203187366/?type=3,2016-05-17 14:10:49,72772,1103,1611,71938,649,161,18,2,4

चौं  रे चम्पू! 
पपड़ियां और चूना  
                                          --अशोक चक्रधर

—चौं रे चम्पू! मुंबई में है गयौ सम्मान?
—हां, चचा। बड़े भाई सरीखे मित्र स्व. हुल्लड़ मुरादाबादी की स्मृति में 'कवितालय फाउंडेशन' ने यह 'शिखर सम्मान' शुरू किया है। पहला मुझे ही दे दिया। नवनीत हुल्लड़ और मेरे पुराने साहित्य-प्रेमी मित्र संजय निरुपम आयोजक थे। इस बार की यात्रा में अमिताभ बच्चन जी से भी भेंट हुई। 
—वाह भई वाह! 
—हां चचा! व्यस्त थे, लेकिन महबूब स्टूडियो में शाम चार बजे बुला लिया। पहुंच गए जी सैट पर। टीवी मॉनीटर के पास हमें प्रेमपूर्वक बिठा दिया गया। अमित जी एक मध्यवर्गीय परिवार के कमरे में सूट पहन कर सोफे पर बैठे हुए शॉट के लिए तैयार थे। ऐक्शन के साथ ही कमरा हिला, दीवारों से चूना गिरा और वे धूल-धूसरित हो गए। निर्देशक ने कट कहने के बाद कहा, ऐक्सिलैंट। टीम के बीस-पच्चीस लोगों ने तालियां बजाईं। पहला टेक ही ओके था। फिर अगले शॉट्स के लिए व्यवस्थाएं बदली गईं। वे स्क्रिप्ट देखते रहे। कपड़ों और चेहरे से चूना और पपड़ियां हटाईं गईं, फिर लगाई गईं। वे अपने काम में तल्लीन थे। हमें भी कोई हड़बड़ी नहीं थी। सम्मान समारोह में सात बजे तक पहुंचना था। लगभग पौन घंटे में तो सारा काम ही सम्पन्न हो गया। सैट से वे नीचे उतरे तो लोग उनके साथ फोटो खिंचाने लगे। उनकी निगाहें मुझे खोज रही थीं। उन्होंने दूर से एक उंगली दिखाई, जिसका आशय था कि बस एक मिनट और। वे आए, कुछ काम की बातें हुईं। शूटिंग के दौरान मैंने जो चंद पंक्तियां लिख मारी थीं, उन्हें थमा दीं। पढ़कर वे मुस्कुराए।
--का लिखौ तैनैं? 
—कागज तो उन्होंने ही रख लिया, पर पंक्तियां याद हैं, 

'हिलती गिरती दीवारों से खिरता चूना, अच्छा-ख़ासा गृह-स्वामी बन गया नमूना। दर्शक नहीं जान पाते हैं इतना लेकिन, कलाकार ने कितना कष्ट उठाया उस दिन! सब कुछ सहता रहा बनाई हुई धाक में, कितना चूना चला गया था वहां नाक में।'

 मान लिया पपड़ियां काग़ज़ की बनी थीं और वह चूना नहीं पाउडर रहा होगा, लेकिन कष्ट तो भोगा न अभिनेता ने। अनावश्यक रसायन गए सांस के साथ। 
—'पा' फिलम में तौ उन्नैं कमाल कद्दियौ हतो।",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/AmitabhBachchan/photos/a.452056338161494.108384.449082841792177/1268440703189716/?type=3,2016-05-17 13:32:09,57504,925,1148,56815,433,80,165,8,3

Always a woman to me! writes Shweta Bachchan Nanda

SHWETA BACHCHAN NANDA | Sun, 8 May 2016-12:00am , Mumbai , dna
Happy Mother's Day, Ma! May we always continue to be in debt of your surplus love.

It is late. My eight-year-old self is awake, staring up at the wooden beams that make up my parents' bedroom. The street lights throw shadows of leaves on the curtain. I nod off, momentarily, but in a minute, I am wakeful again.

Suddenly, a beam of light creeps in from the door. I lay still closing my eyes tight, my mother walks into the room, comes over to the bed where my brother and I lie asleep and kisses our foreheads smoothing the hair from our brows.

In an instant, I am overcome with sleep, and I drift away. It had been that way for days —the year was 1982 and my father lay seriously ill at Breach Candy hospital fighting for his life — while my mother spent every waking minute by his side, only coming home to change, pack a fresh pair of clothes and kiss our sleeping heads.

MY MOTHER IS A STRONG WOMAN.
Giants Stadium, New Jersey: The crowds are cheering and screaming, my father stands on stage in white drainpipes and jacket; the orchestra behind him is playing with the revived energy of a show reaching its finale. He is singing into a mic. My brother and I, seated in an enclosure, watch on, I am shy, so am more retiring. He is jumping all over the place yelling ""Papa"", but his voice is drowned out. A beam of light throws a puddle on stage. My mother, in a white sari her beautiful long black hair flowing, walks into it, she folds her hands to the crowds and they roar. She is then swept off her feet by my father and cradled in his arms like a child. She is laughing while holding the mic up to him. He is singing, ""Jiski biwi choti, uska bhi bada naam hai…""

MY MOTHER IS A BEAUTIFUL, FEMININE WOMAN.
It has been a long day, we welcome being called up to the terrace, wading our way between the pleats of our saris. The moon is a jarring milky stain, on a pollution-fuelled Vantablack sky. A flickering oil lamp ditheringly splatters light on a sieve. My mother's face is luminous in it, she looks at my father through the sieve, in the customary prayer — of Hindu women who observe Karva Chauth, she has been fasting all day. My father gives her a drink of water and something sweet, and then bellows for her dinner to be served immediately.

MY MOTHER IS A TRADITIONAL WOMAN.
It is a scorching hot July day. We are sitting in the visitors' gallery of the Indian Parliament, beneath us scattered like gleaming white shells on a sandy beach, are some of India's most distinguished and accomplished people. My mother is among them. I keep hoping she will turn back and look at us so we can wave at her; she does not.

Her name is called and she stands to take her oath of office. ""Main Jaya Bachchan…,"" she intones in a voice not unlike when she is admonishing us for bad grades or behaviour — firm and resolute. She is seated again.

As we leave Parliament, bolts of flashlights temporarily pin us to our place, my father walks into it and stands by my mother, he puts his arm around her with pride, she beams up at him.

MY MOTHER IS A CAREER WOMAN.

Ten things to know about gymnast Dipa :
- Dipa Karmakar's father is a weightlifting coach and served half a decade in the Andaman Islands training athletes.

– Dipa Karmakar was nursing a slight ankle injury in Glasgow at the 2014 Commonwealth Games but still scored 15.100 in the vault event to bag a bronze. Before this attempt, she stood eighth.

– Dipa Karmakar began working in gymnastics at the age of 5. Up until the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010, she had been practicing and competing on irregular sized landing mats (10cm as against the norm of 30cm).

– Dipa Karmakar is one of the few female gymnasts to successfully land the Produnova and get the top score of 15.100 which is a combination of 7.000 for difficulty and 8.100 for execution and 0.100 for penalty. The Produnova involves running full tilt towards the springboard, a jump followed by blocking the hands, swinging the legs into full rotation while in flight for twin somersaults and then a frontal landing with complete balance. If it goes wrong, it can break the spine and the neck.

– Dipa Karmakar had gone eight months without practice before the World Championships owing to lack of a federation. Thereafter she would learn the Tsukahara in three months flat, something her peers had been doing for at least three years.

– As a child, Dipa Karmakar had flat feet which makes her achievements even more commendable. She said in an interview that she had to work extra hard to curver her feet.

– Dipa Karmakar has had only one coach since she took up the sport – veteran Bisbeshwar Nandi.

– Since 2007, Dipa Karmakar has won 77 medals including 67 golds, in various levels of competitions ranging from state to international.

– Dipa Karmakar won the Junior Nationals in Jalpaiguri at the age of 14.

– Dipa Karmakar also created history when she progressed to the finals of the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship where she eventually finished fifth.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/AmitabhBachchan/photos/a.452056338161494.108384.449082841792177/1249049921795461/?type=3,2016-04-18 14:49:40,46074,744,774,45670,274,114,14,0,2

It is extremely unfortunate and terribly sad, what happened today at the Kollam temple. 
It was the latest in a grim series of fires and stampedes at temples and during religious festivals, where huge crowds routinely gather. Prayers for the ones who lost their lives in these.

Here is a list of some of the worst such disasters in India in recent years:

2008 

August 3: About 150 Hindu worshippers are killed in a temple stampede sparked by rumours of a landslide in northern Himachal Pradesh state.

September 30: Some 224 pilgrims die in a stampede when worshippers rush to reach a hilltop temple in the northern city of Jodhpur.

2010

March 4: Sixty-three people, mostly women and children, are killed in a stampede at a temple where free clothes are being doled out in northern Uttar Pradesh state.

2011

January 14: Some 102 Hindu devotees are killed in a stampede which breaks out when thousands of pilgrims make their way home after an annual pilgrimage in Kerala state.

November 8: Sixteen people including 14 women die in a stampede at a religious ceremony near the holy Hindu city of Haridwar.

2012

November 19: Eighteen women and children are crushed to death in a stampede when a rope bridge collapses at a Hindu festival in eastern Bihar state.

2013

February 10: At least 36 people are trampled to death as pilgrims head home from the Kumbh Mela religious festival on the banks of the River Ganges.

October 13: A stampede near a temple kills at least 115 people in Madhya Pradesh state, where up to 400,000 devotees were gathered. Twenty-one people, including all 17 police from a local station, are suspended after the tragedy.

Ratangarh town where the disaster occurred was the scene of a similar stampede seven years earlier, when 50 people were crushed to death.

2014

January 18: At least 18 people die and more than 40 are injured in a stampede in Mumbai when a large crowd gathered to pay their last respects to a Muslim spiritual leader.

October 3: Some 32 people are killed in a stampede at a popular Hindu festival in eastern India after panic erupts following rumours of an electrical fire.

2015

July 14: A stampede on the banks of a holy river crushes 27 pilgrims to death and injures dozens in southern India.

2016

April 10: A huge fire sweeps through a temple in Kollam - southern India, killing more than 100 people.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/AmitabhBachchan/photos/a.452056338161494.108384.449082841792177/1243565569010563/?type=3,2016-04-10 14:28:06,43084,752,746,42561,219,14,8,280,2

I have diligently responded to all the queries and notices sent by them. I am, a law-abiding citizen of the country.

I wish to reiterate, that on the Panama Papers reportage in the Indian Express, I have not been a director on the Board of the 4 Companies as mentioned in an earlier report. I am happy that the GOI has instituted a thorough investigation on this issue, for, I myself am keen to know how my name appears in connection with those 4 Companies.

I have been reading comments about my removal from the Brand Ambassadorship of the Maharashtra Tiger Preservation campaign. This is the prerogative of the Government of Maharashtra, which I shall humbly respect. Nonetheless, I wish to state that whatever the decision, I shall continue to work towards the social causes that I am associated with – Tiger Preservation, Polio, Swatch Bharat, TB, Hepatitis B, Diabetes, Family Planning – in my individual personal capacity.""

Forbes recently released its first global list of highest paid actors. Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar are among the world's top ten actors in the list. Amitabh and Salman entered the list in the joint seventh place, with estimated earnings of $33.5 million in the past year. Akshay Kumar followed behind in the ninth place, with $32.5 million. Shah Rukh Khan (at 18) and Ranbir Kapoor (at 30) with estimated earnings of $26 million and $15 million respectively, also made it to the list.

These celebrities are also among the highest taxpayers in India and are considered to be conscientious contributors to the national exchequer. In fact, most of the film industry comprises stars who are financially smart, invest wisely, maintain accounts professionally, and pay their taxes honestly. And, by and large, they have their feet firmly planted on the ground.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/AmitabhBachchan/photos/a.452056338161494.108384.449082841792177/1241621255871661/?type=3,2016-04-07 18:52:50,40484,840,548,40274,180,24,5,0,1

The many stories of Mofijul and Rafiza

M.J. Akbar

Any good narrative has a sub-plot; this short story has many.

Mofijul Rahima Sheikh, 22, had started work in the family craft of weaving, in his village in Bengal. He earned about Rs 200 a day. He was already married, to 18-year-old Rafiza Bibi; they had a baby daughter. He was not content with a subsistence income. He dreamt of Kerala, where, he had heard, you could earn Rs 400 or more a day as construction labour. It was not an innovative thought; Bengal has become a migrant economy and Kerala, with its booming NRI housing industry, had become the latest destination of choice for young Bengali men.

He had, however, to finance the trip. He needed at least Rs 600, and that was not as easy as it might seem. Moneylenders charged punishing rates of interest. Mofijul got a loan from a childhood friend for which he was deeply grateful.

It is the poor who come to the help of the poor, if they can.

Mofijul found shelter, at a rent of Rs 1,000 for a bed in a room with a dozen other men. He had only a hundred rupees left when he got work; twelve hours of hard labour. But at the end of the first day there was the satisfaction of earning twice the income in Bengal. On his way back from work he saw a physically challenged person selling lottery tickets. Out of sympathy, he bought one ticket for Rs 50. It was a gesture: once again, proving that only those who have experienced poverty truly understand it and reach out. Mofijul did not hope to win anything; he just wanted to help a ticket seller whose condition was clearly even more miserable than his. He was stunned when he learnt that he purchased the winning ticket of Rs 1 crore.

An amazed, and perhaps bewildered, Mofijul called his family on his mobile. After disbelief had evaporated, he got some good advice. Mofijul was told to go to a police station and spend the night there so that he and his ticket could be safe until he had submitted his claim. The Kerala police were extremely considerate. They gave the young man shelter and security, and then escorted him to a bank to deposit his ticket.

Mofijul returned to his Bengal village, a celebrity. The press, inevitably, asked him what he would do with the windfall. His father, a dreamer of the ultimate Bengali dream, said he would build a house. Relatives suggested he could open a sari shop: it was a trade they understood.

But it is his wife, Rafiza Bibi, who understood how this money could change their lives and shape India's future. ""No one in my family studied beyond Class 1,"" she said. ""My daughter should go to an English medium school.""

Notes:

* Half a billion Indians survive like Mofijul, in the twilight of uncertainty, worried about the next day's meal for the family. The plight of Muslims in rural Bengal is haunting: 80% of them, according to a recent survey, live on or below the poverty line. They have been betrayed by those they put into power.

* Those on the poverty line have no surplus or savings. They must borrow even when they want Rs 600. This is the literal definition of a hand-to-mouth existence.

* Weaving has been the pride of Bengal for generations, an art that brought the world's merchants from the era of Julius Caesar [as recorded by Pliny, the Roman historian] through the Portugal of the middle ages and Elizabethan Britain to India's shores. Bengal produced at least 150 kinds of textiles. Bandana, calico, chintz, dungaree, gingham and taffeta are words of Bengali origin. Today a taanti, or weaver, earns just Rs 200 a day. He can get twice or thrice that sum by carrying bricks on his head. Something is wrong somewhere.

* One of the truly great inventions of history is the mobile phone. It cuts across class, empowers the poor and enhances their quality of life. No one leaves home voluntarily; only hunger forces you to do so. Not too long ago, distance meant silence. The only hope was an occasional postcard. Today a daily conversation keeps relationships warm, and families informed. It is a miracle for young men and women who saw their fathers once a year, perhaps for a couple of weeks, but today know instantly if their child is suffering from a cold. Technology is in harmony with democracy.

* Tribute is due to the Kerala police station. I can name more than one state where an anonymous holder of a lottery ticket might consider a police station the last place to seek protection.

* The Roman goddess Fortuna is generally portrayed as blind. When she showered her blessings on Rafiza Bibi, Fortuna had her eyes wide open. Everyone else wanted something for the present. Rafiza sought the future.

Nanu Banna तेजाब के हमले में घायल एक लड़की के दिल से निकलीं कुछ पंक्तियाँ---

चलो, फेंक दिया..सो फेंक दिया....
अब कसूर भी बता दो मेरा..
तुम्हारा इजहार था..मेरा इन्कार था..
बस इतनी सी बात पर..
फूंक दिया तुमने चेहरा मेरा....
गलती शायद मेरी थी..
प्यार तुम्हारा देख न सकी..
इतना पाक प्यार था..
कि उसको मैं समझ ना सकी....
अब अपनी गलती मानती हूँ..
क्या अब तुम ... अपनाओगे मुझको?
क्या अब अपना ... बनाओगे मुझको?
क्या अब ... सहलाओगे मेरे चहरे को?
जिन पर अब फफोले हैं..
मेरी आंखों में आंखें डालकर देखोगे?
जो अब अन्दर धस चुकी हैं..
जिनकी पलकें सारी जल चुकी हैं..
चलाओगे अपनी उंगलियाँ मेरे गालों पर?
जिन पर पड़े छालों से अब पानी निकलता है..
हाँ, शायद तुम कर लोगे....
तुम्हारा प्यार तो सच्चा है ना?
अच्छा! एक बात तो बताओये..
ख्याल 'तेजाब' का कहाँ से आया?
क्या किसी ने तुम्हें बताया?
या जेहन में तुम्हारे खुद ही आया?
अब कैसा महसूस करते हो तुम मुझे जलाकर?
गौरान्वित..???
या पहले से ज्यादा और भी मर्दाना...???
तुम्हें पता है सिर्फ मेरा चेहरा जला है ..
जिस्म अभी पूरा बाकी है..
एक सलाह दूँ!
एक तेजाब का तालाब बनवाओ..
फिर इसमें मुझसे छलाँग लगवाओ..
जब पूरी जल जाऊँगी मैं..
फिर शायद तुम्हारा प्यार मुझमें और गहरा और सच्चा होगा....
एक दुआ है....
अगले जन्म में मैं तुम्हारी बेटी बनूँ..
और मुझे तुम जैसा आशिक फिर मिले..
शायद तुम फिर समझ पाओगे..
तुम्हारी इस हरकत से ..
मुझे और मेरे परिवार को ..
कितना दर्द सहना पड़ा है..
तुमने मेरा पूरा जीवन..
बर्बाद कर दिया है...﻿ll",,status,,2016-03-22 00:25:52,15736,1254,1611,15398,65,6,1,254,12

449082841792177_1218843161482804,"FB 1274 -Today March 14, is celebrated as Pi Day as the date comes to 3.14. This year is very special because the date today is 3.14.16

It was Aryabhatta-I who was the first to give the correct value of Pi upto 4 decimal places as 3.1416. Not just that, he also stated that this value is approximate and not accurate which means he probably knew the irrational nature of Pi.

Below is the verse from Aryabhatiyam where he states the calculation of the value of Pi.

चतुरधिकम् शतम्, अष्टगुणम् द्वाषष्टि
तथा सहस्राणाम् अयुत द्वय विष्कम्भस्य
आसन्न: वृत्त

चतुरधिकम् शतम् = 100+4 = 104; अष्टगुणम् = 104 * 8 = 832; द्वाषष्टि = 62; तथा = thus; सहस्राणाम् = 62 * 1000 = 62,000; अयुत = ten thousand fold;द्वय = by two; विष्कम्भस्य = of the diameter of a circle; आसन्न: = approximately; वृत्त = circle; परिणाह: = circumference

(((100+4) * 8 + (62 * 1000)) / 20000) * Diameter = Circumfrence of a circle, approximately.

(62,832 / 20,000) * Diameter = Circumfrence of a circle, approximately
or 3.1416 * D = Circumfrence of a circle, approximately.

While there is a lot of discussion about how the symbol for Pi, was first used by William Jones and how the value of pi was first used by Archimedes. However, the value of pi to its correct approximation to 4 digits was first proposed by Aryabhatta. On Pi-Day, it is important to remember the contribution of this great Rishi of Bharat.
